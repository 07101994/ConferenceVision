# What are these Achievements all about?

The Conference Vision app uses [Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai/) services on device to recognize these products in the photos you take.

To gain an achievement, take a photo that include the product logo, branding, and even booth if there happens to be one at the event.

## This is broken, I should have earned an achievement!

Email your photo(s) to [david.ortinau@microsoft.com](mailto:david.ortinau@microsoft.com).

The vision model needs training, and that's an iterative process. If you have taken a photo that you are certain should have gained you an achievement, please email that photo with the details to [david.ortinau@microsoft.com](mailto:david.ortinau@microsoft.com) to be included in the next training set. During Build we will work to update the model daily and ship new builds to AppCenter.
